# Image Forgery Detection Using Error Level Analysis (ELA)

This project focuses on detecting image forgeries using Error Level Analysis (ELA) combined with machine learning models. The primary goal is to identify whether an image has been altered or manipulated by analyzing the error levels present in compressed versions of the image.

# Dataset
The custom dataset used in this project is extracted from the CASIA v2 dataset, which contains various manipulated and authentic images. The dataset has been preprocessed to facilitate the analysis and model training.

# Project Structure
Code: The main code file is Image_Forgery_Detection.py, which contains the implementation of the ELA technique along with the machine learning models (DenseNet121, ResNet101, VGG19) used for classification.

Presentation: The project presentation, detailing the methodology, results, and conclusions, is provided in the accompanying PPT file.

Dataset: The dataset used for training and evaluation is available in the Dataset/ folder, which should be located in the same directory as the code file. The dataset must be extracted and placed properly to ensure smooth execution of the code.

# Results
The results of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of ELA combined with state-of-the-art machine learning models in detecting image manipulations. The detailed results are discussed in the presentation file.

# Future Work
* Explore additional datasets to improve model robustness.
* Investigate alternative image processing techniques for forgery detection.
* Implement real-time forgery detection in a web or mobile application.
